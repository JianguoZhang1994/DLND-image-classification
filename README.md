# DLND2-image-classification-CNN
We build a **Convolutional Neural Network** to classify  [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) with **60000** images
The dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. 

The program running on [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/) g2.2xlarge instance type with 32GiB storage, you can also run on your local GPU device. ![image](https://github.com/JianguoZhang1994/DLND2-image-classification-CNN/blob/master/intance_type.png)
