# DLND2-image-classification-CNN
We build a **Convolutional Neural Network** to classify  [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) with **60000** images
The dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. 

The program running on [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/) **g2.2xlarge**
